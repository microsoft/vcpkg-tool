# vcpkg_registry_release_process

This document describes the acceptance criteria / process we use when doing a vcpkg registry release.

1. Make sure the contents of the repo have what you want to release and match a nightly CI run.
1. Create a git tag for the release.
    ```console
    >git fetch origin # Where origin is whichever remote points to microsoft/vcpkg
    >git switch -d <A tested SHA>
    >git tag 2023.10.19    # Replace this with the date of that SHA
    >git push origin 2023.10.19
    ```
1. Run vcpkg z-changelog `<SHA OF LAST RELEASE>` > `path/to/results.md`
1. Create a new GitHub release in the registry repo on the tag.
1. Run 'auto generate release notes'
1. Change `## New Contributors` to `#### New Contributors`
1. Copy the contents to the end of `path/to/results.md` (the `#### New Contributors` part should line up)
1. Change the link to the full rebuild.
1. Fill out the block about tool release changes.
1. Fill out the number of ports per platform from the matching rebuild.
1. Copy `path/to/results.md` into the GitHub release and publish it. (You can delete `path/to/results.md` now :))
1. After a blog post for that release is authored, add a link to the blog post to the release.
